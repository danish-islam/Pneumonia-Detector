# Pneumonia Detector

## What is the Pneumonia Detector?
The pneumonia detector is a project where x-ray images can be uploaded to a website and the trained model returns a prediction about whether it has pneumonia or not. This is intended to be used as an aid for physicians during the diagnostic process. The model was deployed using heroku and can be found here: https://xray-pneumonia-detector.herokuapp.com/
